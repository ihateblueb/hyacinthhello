[SIZE=6]HyacinthHello[/SIZE]

Simple plugin for players to set their own custom join, leave, and death messages.

Messages can be set from /joinmsg, /leavemsg, and deathmsg and are stored in the plugin directory under PlayerDatabase.

[SIZE=5]Commands[/SIZE]

Messages are set with commands. You can clear a message by passing a blank value.
- /joinmsg [message]
- /leavemsg [message]
- /deathmsg [message]

Moderators can override messages of other users if they have the hyacinthhello.mod permission node.
- /hh mod joinmsg [user] [message]
- /hh mod leavemsg [user] [message]
- /hh mod deathmsg [user] [message]

[SIZE=5]Configuration[/SIZE]

The configuration allows you to modify how the plugin looks. Here's an example:

[code]
enabled: true # Whether to enable the plugin
prefix: "" # Prefix before command responses
wrapper-left: "&e&o" # Prefix for messages
wrapper-right: "" # Suffix for messages
maximum-message-length: 60 # Checked when player sets message
regex-filters: # Regex filters don't need to be wrapped in /
  - "simpleexactmatch"
  - "t[a-zA-Z]st"
[/code]

[SIZE=5]Permissions[/SIZE]

- [B]hyacinthhello.use[/B] to use any commands
- [B]hyacinthhello.mod[/B] to use mod commands
- [B]hyacinthhello.joinmsg[/B] to set and have join messages sent
- [B]hyacinthhello.leavemsg[/B] to set and have leave messages sent
- [B]hyacinthhello.deathmsg[/B] to set and have death messages sent
- [B]hyacinthhello.color[/B] to use color in messages

[SIZE=5]Placeholders[/SIZE]

Each message type has its own placeholder. Placeholders will not include the wrappers set in the config.
- %hyacinthhello_join%
- %hyacinthhello_leave%
- %hyacinthhello_death%

Placeholders will also have color and formatting in them if the player has permission. You can exclude that:
- %hyacinthhello_join-clean%
- %hyacinthhello_leave-clean%
- %hyacinthhello_death-clean%

You can also pass a username to get a specific player's message.
- %hyacinthhello_join_[username]%

[SIZE=5]Velocity[/SIZE]

With HyacinthHello Velocity, you can have HyacinthHello's custom messages broadcasted across your entire network.

The Velocity plugin can just forward to the other servers, or take over all join, leave, and death messages across the proxy. The latter option is recommended.

Requires Redis.

On your server:

[code]
proxy-mode: true
proxy-redis:
  address: 0.0.0.0 # Your redis address, this is likely fine
  port: 6379 # Your redis port, this is likely fine
  channel: hyacinthhello # Leave default, unless you have multiple proxies with HyacinthHello
[/code]

On your proxy:

[code]
# Variables:
#   {p}   player name
#   {s}   server name
#   {m}   forwarded message
redis:
  address: 0.0.0.0 # Your redis address, this is likely fine
  port: 6379 # Your redis port, this is likely fine
  prefix: hyacinthhello # Leave default, unless you have multiple proxies with HyacinthHello

override-backends: true # Overrides default and custom messages.
join-message: '<yellow>{p} joined {s}' # Allows setting custom formatting for join
leave-message: '<yellow>{p} left {s}' # Allows setting custom formatting for leave
death-message: '<yellow>{m}' # Just wraps over the message forwarded from backend servers

wrapper-left: '&e&o'
wrapper-right: ''
[/code]
